# New Toxicology Evaluations Section (NTES)

The New Toxicology Evaluations Section (NTES) at the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) provides essential information on the hazards and risks posed by chemicals in the environment and consumer products. We develop new and scientifically valid approaches for understanding chemical hazards that may be used to establish guidance levels or priorities for chemicals in drinking water, air emissions, sport fish, waste sites, and emergency response actions, as well as safer substitutes for chemicals. NTES's work provides important state guidance for regulators, policymakers, and emergency responders on harmful chemicals that otherwise would remain unassessed.

## Our Work

NTES staff conduct original research into the development and application of novel risk assessment methods. We integrate whole-animal toxicology tests with data from new approach methods (NAMs)—including computational modeling, in-vitro tests, and assays in alternative animal species—to predict human health risks. Our work includes:

- Developing hazard and dose-response assessments for unassessed chemicals and chemical groups of high priority or emerging interest to California state agencies
- Applying new computational-toxicology approaches to support regulatory standards
- Collaborating with academic researchers on the development and refinement of novel risk assessment methods
- Publishing scientific papers and technical reports to build acceptance of new methodologies
