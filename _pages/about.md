The New Toxicology Evaluations Section (NTES) at the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) provides independent, science-based evaluations of the hazards and risks posed by chemicals found in the environment and in consumer products. NTES develops and applies new, scientifically valid approaches for characterizing chemical hazards and exposures, and translates that science into robust evaluations that can be used to establish guidance levels or inform priorities for action.

NTES evaluations support a wide range of public health decisions, including guidance for chemicals in drinking water, air emissions, sport fish consumption, waste site management, and emergency response actions, as well as assessments to identify safer substitutes for hazardous chemicals. Our work provides important state-level guidance for regulators, policymakers, and emergency responders on harmful chemicals that might otherwise remain unassessed.

NTES relies on transparent methods, peer-reviewed science, and collaboration with other experts to ensure evaluations are current, evidence-based, and protective of public health. For program contacts, data requests, or media inquiries, please see the contact information at the bottom of this page.

**NTES-hosted Applications**

NTES develops and maintains a suite of open-source R/Shiny applications for toxicology, chemical hazard assessment, and exposure modeling. See the [**Applications**](/apps/) page for detailed information, deployment links, and quick-start guides for each tool:

- **[OEHHA Data Explorer](https://oehha.shinyapps.io/OEHHA-Data-Explorer_v1-0/)** — Unify and interrogate thousands of chemicals across regulatory, toxicological, exposure, and production data.
- **[OEHHA PFAS PK Modelling Application](https://oehha.shinyapps.io/PFAS_TK/)** — Simulate pharmacokinetics of PFAS across species, models, and exposure scenarios.
- **[Leggett+ Lead PBPK](https://oehha.shinyapps.io/LeggettPlus/)** — Model age-specific lead kinetics for occupational and environmental exposures.
